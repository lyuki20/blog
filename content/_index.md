### about me

I'm Yuki Tsutsumi, an SRE engineer currently based in Tokyo. I specialize in cloud infrastructure, backend systems, and automation, often working with AWS, Python/Bash, and distributed architectures.

When I'm not troubleshooting infrastructure, I enjoy exploring data-driven optimization, learning new technologies, and contributing to collaborative engineering environments.
