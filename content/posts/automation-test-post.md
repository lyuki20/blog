This post was created automatically to verify the end-to-end workflow.

- The source lives in the Obsidian vault (E:/iCloud/iCloudDrive/Obsidian/notes/posts).
- The deployment script pulls it into the Hugo site, builds, commits, and publishes.

If you can read this on the live site, the sync is working as expected.
